Definitely a sipper and not a crushable beer. My ABV came in at about 8.95%. OG: 1.074, FG: 1.006.One issued I ran into was this beer has been in bottles for about 6 weeks and it still isn't carbonated to the extent I would like.

As with a te4a bag, you shouldn't leave the grains in the hot water for too long...I typically use 30 minutes at 150-155 degrees.  I initially heat the water to about 155 or a touch more, so that when you put in the relatively colder grains, it brings the temperature of the mixture down to close to what you desire.  I also put the grain in one of the fine mesh cloth bags to act as a tea bag would, and keeps the grains together when you take them out of the water.  Also as with a tea bag, I dunk the bag of grain up and down several times to allow the water to mix well around the grain an leach off all of the sugars that are in there and whatever other good stuff is in the grain.  After the grains have steeped the 30 minutes, I take the bag out and put it in a colander...spaghetti strainer...over my boil pot.  I then poured 1 gallon of 170 degree water slowly over the bag of grains, to leach out the last vestiges of sugar and good stuff from the grain.  There ya have it!!
